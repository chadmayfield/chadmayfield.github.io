Hello.

As you can see I am currently getting my site up and running after almost 10 years of partial updates and hallow promises of goodies.  Please be patient with my while I work.  I am hosting this on github.com with, Pixyll, a very simple theme yet beautiful theme for Jekyll.  Checkout it out at [Github repository](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) (and it's open source [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)).
