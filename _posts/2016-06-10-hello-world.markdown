Hello.

It has truly been a long time.  I started my first blog in [2004](https://web.archive.org/web/20041204171336/http://chadmayfield.com/blog/), that's over ten years ago!  Since then my site (and other sites I used) have gone back and forth between partially built to not built at all, blogging and not blogging.  So, as you can see I am currently getting my site up and running <strong>completely this time</strong>.  I plan on blogging here just a bit, no more hollow promises from me, I'm going to do it!  And in the process I might just share some goodies.

As you can see I am hosting this on github.com with, Pixyll, a very simple, yet beautiful theme for Jekyll.  Checkout it out on [Github](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) (and plus it's open source!).
