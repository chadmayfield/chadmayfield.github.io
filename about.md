My name is Chad Mayfield, obviously. I've been in technology industry for 15+ years with experience in support and QA, but mostly in development/engineering.  Currently I am a Senior Software Engineer for Forcepoint (a Raytheon company) specializing in Linux System Engineering from the "metal to the middleware" with an slight emphasis on security/compliance.  Basically, I build stuff and then try to make it secure.

I live in the beautiful state of Utah with my family (whom I actually like) and try to travel whenever I get the chance.
