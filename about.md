My name is Chad Mayfield, obviously. I've been in the technology industry for 15+ years with some experience in support and QA, but mostly in development.  Currently I am a Senior Software Engineer for Forcepoint (a Raytheon company) specializing in Linux Systems Engineering.  I usually work on the "metal to the middleware" with an emphasis on security and compliance.  I am a builder and a wanna be maker.

Looking for some projects I've done? Visit [the kyln](http://kyln.io/).

I live in the beautiful state of Utah with my family (whom I actually like) and try to travel whenever I get the chance.
